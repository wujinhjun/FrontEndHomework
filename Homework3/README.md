# homework3: a todo by react

This is a test for my network connection. Because I am off campus now, I need to verify the git is working well.

This update is in 3.21, I create a new folder in the github. Yeah, it's an easy process, but I also made some mistakes.  

Today is 3.26, I finished most of requirements of this homework. Of course, the most means for me. Although I would love to replicate the to-do-list, I am new to the Fronted and the React. Therefore, there are still shortcoming in this assignment. At the same time, it is worthing mentioning that I have to reference some open source code. Even almost the css are copied by me from the example website. It is a pity.  

At the last, I almost forget one thing: this homework should be one component away, and I should be done it later.  

Update from 21:39, I found that there may have been some problems with my approach. I should not be able to complete all the functions, which is a big pity. Sorry, for teacher and me.
