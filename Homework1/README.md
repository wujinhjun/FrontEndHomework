# The first homework

The first assignment is imitate a beautiful website from the [awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/)  

[This is the example](https://www.lanekassen.no/en-US/)  

Initially, I thought it is so easy to imitate it. However, I overstimated my abilities. In fact, the front end is different from script written in python or processing(a java language). In figma, I can make the craft so fast, but by html&CSS, I can't even align the elements or div.  

Today is 3.3, my homework only finished a little, maybe by saturday, I can finish a part of this homework.  

Sorry, at the moment, there is only homework with a low degree of completion.
