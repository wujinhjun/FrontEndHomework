# FrontEndHomework

This is a repository store homework about the Front-End homework.  

Of course, my major is industrial design and I don't have a good code base, so my homework might be not exciting. Pardon me, OK? Thank you!

Before this lesson, I've write some code or script by C/python/lua. And also create some prototype by using figma. However, I've not write Front-End code before. Because I may be an UX/UI designer and even be a TA engineer, I want to learn about workflow of engineers through this course. Maybe the homework are difficult, but I will try to do my best.  

It is worth mentioning that my English is not good, so readmes may have some grammatical errors. Maybe need to bear me.
