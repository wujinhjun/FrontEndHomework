# the assignment 6

a homework based on front-end performance optimization  

But, it is a pity that limited by my front-end level, I can't even implement the function very well. So I can't achieve performance optimization.

Therefore, I can only achieve a little bit base on a [to-do-mvc](https://github.com/wujinhjun/To-Do-MVC-react-try) (this is last edition)

 1. I used [the clean-css](https://www.cleancss.com/css-minify/) to minify my css.
 2. I used the `<React-Fragement></React-Fragement>` instead of `<div></div>`.
 3. I used the `lazy()`&`suspense` to split code.
