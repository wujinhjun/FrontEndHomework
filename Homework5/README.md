# the assignment 5:

I will imitate [the modernjs](https://modernjs.dev/)

At the begining, I think this homework is easy. Homever, I find the modern-js main page not only has the HTML&CSS, some animation based on the javascript/typescript and I am not good at the javascript. Therefore, I have to use so many media finder. It's so ugly, so maybe I will learn some skill about javascript and animation in this hoilday to finish the homework better.

Of course, thank you,sir, for your guidance.
