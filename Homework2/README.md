# Homework for the third week

This is a game made with javascript. Because my level of javascript is not good, maybe this homework is not beautiful.  

I have to say that for me, this assignment is also very difficult. Therefore, I referenced a lot of open source code to finish it.  

So this homework should not be so ideal, it's real a pity.  

In fact, it is difficult to make a game without the help of engines and editors like unity or unreal.
