# the assignment4

This is a treaty based on the nodejs

This is update on May 1st. Before today, I had actually spent a weel thinking about it.

At the begining, something went wrong with my thinking, even though I consulted a lot of people, including teachers, friends, and big men. I'm a bit silly at that time, However, I don't fully understand the assignment.

But this afternoon, I seemed to suddenly understand teacher's meaning, tried it, found that there seemed to be a possibility, and after a while of debugging, it seemed to be done. Oh, it's cool.

This is the picture when the code run:
